First,
some
***
Since
much
of
the
book
is
about
the
consequences
of
***
it
is
necessary
to
begin
with
some
kind
of
working
definition
of
the
term
(the
grim
duty
of
any
writer
of
introductions).
As
most
readers
will
be
aware,
***
is
a
notoriously
amorphous
concept.
Yet,
***
in
mind
that
words
tend
to
mean
'what
they've
come
to
mean',
we
can
work
***
a
sense-to
try
to
fix
certain
essentials.
Thus,
at
a
very
basic
level,
we
can
say
that
***
was/is
a
subculture
best
characterised
as
being
part
youth
rebellion,
part
artistic
statement.
It
had
its
high
point
from
1976
to
1979,
and
was
most
visible
in
Britain
and
America.
It
had
its
primary
manifestation
in
music-and
specifically
in
the
disaffected
rock
and
roll
of
bands
like
the
Sex
Pistols
and
the
Clash.
Philosophically,
it
had
no
'set
agenda'
like
the
hippy
movement
that
preceded
it,
but
nevertheless
stood
for
***
attitudes,
among
them:
an
emphasis
on
negationism
(rather
than
nihilism);
a
consciousness
of
class-based
politics
(with
a
stress
on
'workingclass
credibility');
and
a
belief
in
spontaneity
and
'doing
it
yourself'.
